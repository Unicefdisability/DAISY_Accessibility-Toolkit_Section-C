				<a href="d202_5.smil#txt_2040">UNICEF works across more than 190 countries and territories, promoting the rights and wellbeing of every child in everything we do.   UNICEF advocates for and supports governments to create enabling environments and equal opportunities for all children to survive and thrive, including the over 240 million boys and girls with disabilities living in the world today.</a>
			</p>
			<p id="id_71">
				<a href="d202_5.smil#txt_2041">Our work on disability inclusion is mandated by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and aligned with the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy (UNDIS) and the UNICEF  Strategic Plan. With the 2017 Executive Directive on Accessibility in Programme-Related Construction Activities (CF/EXD/2017-004), UNICEF  reaffirms its commitment to ensure physical accessibility is a principle for all the infrastructure that is built through our programmes, including in humanitarian action. </a>

			<p id="id_72">
				<a href="d202_5.smil#txt_2042">This toolkit is a result of extensive consultations with UNICEF employees, partners and persons with disabilities.

			<p id="id_73">
				<a href="d202_5.smil#txt_2043">We invite UNICEF colleagues and partners to apply this guidance in their work, to ensure that construction related to our programmes, such as school buildings, health clinics, water and sanitation facilities, are free of environmental barriers. </a>

				<a href="d202_5.smil#txt_2045">UNICEF is committed to promote an accessible and inclusive work environment for every employee and is investing to increase opportunities for persons with disabilities to join our workforce. This Accessibility Toolkit is an important resource to help us deliver on this commitment, respecting and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in programmes and operations across the organization. </a>
			</p>
			<p id="id_77">
				<a href="d202_5.smil#txt_2046">In 2014, a staff survey on accessibility of UNICEF programmes and premises revealed that 84 per cent of offices required awareness-raising materials and technical capacity on accessibility.  In a follow-up All-Staff Survey in 2019, only 39 per cent of respondents deemed their office space was physically accessible for persons with disabilities. </a>
			</p>
			<p id="id_78">
				<a href="d202_5.smil#txt_2047">To address the growing internal demand for resources to improve our office buildings, we established a  Greening and Accessibility Fund, developed guidance to support renovations for environmentally friendly and accessible premises and set up the Environmental Footprint and Accessibility Assessment Tool (EFAAT). </a>
			</p>
			<p id="id_79">
				<a href="d202_5.smil#txt_2048">Data as of 2021 shows us that 52 per cent of UNICEF premises meet “level 1”, the minimum organisational requirements for accessibility. But we can do better, and we must do better.  UNICEF’s Strategic Plan Indicator E2.5 on Percentage of UNICEF offices that are disability inclusive and accessible, sets a target of 100% by 2025.  This is an ambitious target, but for UNICEF’s 100% organizational commitment on disability inclusion, only a target of 100% of accessibility in our premises and operations can be acceptable. </a>

It can support children like Frinpali, a seven- year-old boy who uses a wheelchair and now receives appropriate education in Burkina Faso because his school has been made accessible. This toolkit has been conceived as an instrument to facilitate the dialogue with partners and the involvement of organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs)  on accessibility-related issues. And it has been developed with UNICEF’s current and future employees with disabilities and other organizations in mind, so that the facilities they work in are made more accessible and inclusive for all.</a>

Equal access to transportation, media, information and communication technologies, and public services and facilities, such as schools, libraries and town halls, facilitates the participation of persons with disabilities, in both urban and rural communities.

					<a href="d202_12.smil#txt_2228">The accessibility continuum is a concept that describes the experience of children, adults with disabilities and older persons departing from their homes, using pathways, crossing roads and taking transportation to reach, enter and use services and facilities. These facilities can be libraries, public meeting halls, sports fields, health care facilities, courthouses, marketplaces, conference rooms, office buildings, etc. A continuous route means that circulating through it is safe, unrestricted and possible using a wheelchair,  a walking frame or a service dog, with no obstacles or barriers blocking the way. Such a route must be continuous because, like in a chain, if one link is broken, the chain is compromised.</a>

						<a href="d202_23.smil#txt_2440">In 2005, as part of the Humanitarian Reform Agenda, the cluster approach was introduced among several new elements to enhance predictability, accountability  and partnership. The cluster approach aims to address gaps in emergency response and to improve the quality of humanitarian assistance through greater predictability and accountability, and stronger partnership among humanitarian actors. Within this approach, the clusters are groups of humanitarian organizations, both United Nations and non-United Nations agencies, in each of the main sectors of humanitarian action. They are designated by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) and have clear responsibilities for coordination. These formally activated clusters are created when existing coordination mechanisms are overwhelmed or constrained in their ability to respond to identified needs in line with humanitarian principles. The cluster approach ensures that international responses to humanitarian emergencies are predictable and accountable and have clear leadership by making clearer the division of labour between organizations, and their roles and responsibilities in different areas.</a>

					<li id="id_639">
						<a href="d202_23.smil#txt_2441">As a part of UNICEF’s overarching Core Commitments for Children (CCCs), UNICEF supports the leadership and coordination of humanitarian response, along with national and local stakeholders, and serves as Global Cluster Lead Agency (CLA) for three clusters: nutrition; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); and education (as co-CLA with Save the Children). Also, UNICEF is the Focal Point Agency for the Child Protection area of responsibility.</a>
					</li>
					<li id="id_640">
						<a href="d202_23.smil#txt_2442">The cluster approach is organized along a two-tiered structure, involving roles and responsibilities at both the global and country levels. In emergencies in which the cluster approach is applied, UNICEF is requested to lead coordination efforts in the sector or area of activity concerned. At the global level, UNICEF is responsible for establishing broad partnership bases, and thereby promoting greater accountability for cluster results.</a>
